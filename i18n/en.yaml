  translation: "Hostal Aromas del Caribe TRINIDAD is located on the central street of San José. It is a very favorable location for tourists due to its proximity to points of interest, colonial streets, museums, pedestrian areas, shops, bars, restaurants (such as La Botija, La Canchánchara or El Jigüe) and nightlife areas (bars, discos and terraces). Perfect to enjoy Trinidad on foot, without the need for taxis. Very close to the Plaza Mayor (150 m), a place where absolutely everyone passes by, full of life."

  translation: "It is in a Spanish-era building, clearly colonial, built at the end of the 18th century (with original walls, façade and ceilings). It has a room with high ceilings (typical of the colonial era) and furnished with chairs and armchairs from the period. Due to its construction characteristics, it is a cool and very ventilated house. There is a small terrace on the roof of the house."
